# HTML5 and JS Canvas Boilerplate

* Clone this repo to have an instant setup for an HTML Canvas game.
* Start writing your code straight away!
* Canvas is initialized.
* Context is initialized.
* There are:
  - simple key handling functions
  - a main function
  - a game over/restart function
  - WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?!?! :) *
* CODE AWAY!

A lot of this has been 'borrowed' from:\
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

The idea here isn't to build a game for you, or just to steal content from MDN, it's mostly just to cut out the boilerplate stuff and be able to get going as quickly as possible.

\* You can always ask for more, or fork it and PR ;)
