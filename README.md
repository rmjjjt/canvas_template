# HTML5 and JS Canvas Boilerplate

* Clone this repo to have an instant setup for an HTML Canvas game.
* Start writing your code straight away!
* Canvas is initialized.
* Context is initialized.
* There are some key handling functions, a main function, a game over function, WHAT MORE COULD YOU
ASK FOR?!?! :)
* CODE AWAY!

A lot of this has been 'borrowed' from:\

The idea here isn't to build a game for you, or just to steal content from MDN, it's mostly just to cut out the boilerplate stuff and be able to get going as quickly as possible.
